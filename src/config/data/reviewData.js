    title: "GREAT TRIP!",
    content:
      "My 16 year old daughter & I absolutely loved this trip. Our boat guide, Jack was great as was the entire crew. The river was a great mix of relaxing scenery and exciting rapids, especially Clavey Falls. We had a few people in our boat go for an unintended swim, which made it memorable. Food was very good - sandwiches & salads for lunch, french toast and sausage for breakfast, and steak & chicken tacos for dinner. Cooler full of soda and craft beer after the day on the water. Condiments were over the top. The side hikes to swim holes were fun, but I wish I would have purchased grippy water shoes as some of the rocks were very slick. Also wish I would have brought my hammock. No phots offered, so consider bringing a GoPro. Did not use the tent I rented, as the entire group just slept under the stars. Great trip, highly recommend.",

      "Once again OARS delivers an exceptional value in the two day Tuolumne River, wine and dinner outing. As if the thrills of the Tuolumne are not enough, OARS partners with local chefs and wineries to highlight the local culture and provide participants a glimpse into the region. Plus, OARS guides focus on quality meals safely prepared, fun (and safe) river passages and the overall customer experience.",
